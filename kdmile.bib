  abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to several subtasks
	in the RoboCup simulated soccer domain. Keepaway is one such task.
	One notable success in the keepaway domain has been the application
	of SMDP Sarsa(λ) with tile-coding function approximation. However,
	this success was achieved with the help of some significant task
	simplifications, including the delivery of complete, noise-free world-state
	information to the agents. Here we demonstrate that this task simplification
	was unnecessary: the agents are able to learn even in the presence
	of noisy, incomplete information. We also scale up to larger problems
	than have been previously tried. The main contribution of this paper
	is a deeper understanding of the difficulties of scaling up reinforcement
	learning to RoboCup soccer. We address several focused questions
	about the previous results with detailed experiments.},
